# NLP_Sentiment Analysis and Text Similarity Program

Description
This Python program performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using TextBlob and calculates the similarity score between two randomly selected reviews using spaCy.
However it can be used on any text you want to apply sentiment analysis and work on similarity. I downloaded my data from Kaggle to use for my program. Below you will find a link to the data file.

Summary

This Python program analyses sentiment in Amazon product reviews and calculates the similarity between two randomly selected reviews. 
It utilises the following functionalities:

Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob: It determines the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review using TextBlob's polarity score.
Text Similarity Calculation: It calculates the similarity score between two randomly selected reviews using spaCy's language model.
Preprocessing Text Data: The text data from the dataset is preprocessed by converting it to lowercase and stripping extra whitespaces. 

Usage
Ensure you have a CSV file named amazon_product_reviews.csv containing the reviews data.

Install the required dependencies (pandas, spacy, textblob) using pip.

Run the program with Python (python sentiment_analysis.py).
